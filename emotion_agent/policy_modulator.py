policy_modulator.py (V0.9)
==========================
Policy Modulator: turn (objective risk + appraisal + affective state + episodic
memory evidence) into a decision, WITHOUT the affect layer acting as a second
"risk detector".

Design separation (docs/design/phase5_v09_affective_core_design.md):
  Risk Encoder  : how dangerous is this action, objectively (stateless).
  Affective Core: how cautious / anxious is the agent right now (history-shaped).
  PolicyModulator: under the SAME objective risk, how to shift the verification
                   budget, execution threshold and exploration tendency.

Each signal is applied exactly once (no double counting — same principle as the
Phase 4.1 threshold fix):
  * memory evidence      → moves the *effective risk* (decide)
  * affect + appraisal   → moves the *policy budget* (threshold / verification)
